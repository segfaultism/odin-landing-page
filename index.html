        <p class="quote">"Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object,
            and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will
            disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it
            becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes
            the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."</p>
